PG Partition Manager
====================

pg_partman is an extension to create and manage both time-based and serial-based table partition sets. Child table & trigger function creation is all managed by the extension itself. Tables with existing data can also have their data partitioned in easily managed smaller batches. Optional retention policy can automatically drop partitions no longer needed.

INSTALLATION
------------
Recommended: pg_jobmon (>=v1.1.2). PG Job Monitor will automatically be used if it is installed.  
https://github.com/omniti-labs/pg_jobmon

In directory where you downloaded pg_partman to run

    make
    make install

Log into PostgreSQL and run the following commands. Schema can be whatever you wish, but it cannot be changed after installation.

    CREATE SCHEMA partman;
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_partman SCHEMA partman;

Functions must either be run as a superuser or you can set the ownership of the extension functions to a superuser role and they will also work (SECURITY DEFINER is set).

UPGRADE
-------

Make sure all the upgrade scripts for the version you have installed up to the most recent version are in the $/share/extension folder. 

    ALTER EXTENSION pg_partman UPDATE TO '<latest version>';

EXAMPLE
-------

First create a parent table with an appropriate column type for the partitioning type you will do. Apply all defaults, indexes, constraints, privileges & ownership to the parent table and they will be inherited to newly created child tables automatically (not already existing partitions, see docs for how to fix that). Here's one with columns that can be used for either

    CREATE schema test;
    CREATE TABLE test.part_test (col1 serial, col2 text, col3 timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now());

If you're looking to do time-based partitioning, and will only be inserting new data, time-static is an appropriate choice. Just run the create_parent() function with the appropriate parameters

    SELECT partman.create_parent('test.part_test', 'col3', 'time-static', 'daily');

This will turn your table into a parent table and premake 4 future partitions and also make 4 past partitions. To make new partitions for time-based partitioning, use the run_maintenance() function. Ideally, you'd run this as a cronjob to keep new partitions premade in preparation of new data.  There are also options for dynamic on the fly table creation, and integer partitioning columns.

This should be enough to get you started. Please see the [pg_partman.md file](doc/pg_partman.md) in the doc folder for more information on the types of partitioning supported and what the parameters in the create_parent() function mean.
